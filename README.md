Welcome to FPSunreal

The goal of the game is to find the energy core of the Phoenix Module so as to power it up and claim it's unlimited potential. However, there are some enemies that lurk in the labyrinth. You have to deal with those pests and navigate through the labyrinth at the same time.

Notice: There are 2 energy cores in the map. One of them is a fake. You will understand which one is the fake the moment you interact with it!
